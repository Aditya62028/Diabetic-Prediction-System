# Diabetic-Prediction-System
->Develop a robust machine learning model for accurate diabetes prediction based on the given dataset. 
->Conducted a comparative study using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Neighbors models for diabetes prediction based on patient features. 
->Created/deployed diabetes prediction web-application that predicts if the user has diabetes by getting required features.
->Used random-forest, logistic regression algorithm with optimized hyper-parameters to achieve an accuracy of 86%, best accuracy was observed with random-forest, decreasing the False negatives and False positives.
->Tech Stack: HTML/CSS, Python(Flask), API, and Machine Learning.
